# Contact-list
It was a mini project for my college during first year. Had to make it in three days, because being a youngster I messed my schedule and time managementðŸ—¿

# Details
## What the program does?
The program works like a normal contact list that we use in our phone except for some functionalities:- 
### You can:-
1. Save a contact
2. Delete a contact
3. Search a contact

### You cannot:- 
1. Edit an existing contact

### Code details:-
- The program/code is written in Python.
- The GUI is made using Tkinter, and the backend is Python again, which is connected to a database.
- The database is made using MySQLite.
- The database is created when you run the code. Database is created in the 'try' block. If the database table already exists, then the program starts executing from 'finally' block. This 'finally' block has the GUI and rest of the code(modules,queries,etc.)
